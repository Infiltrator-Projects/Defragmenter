This document records the current release safety case. Historical audit-development detail remains in Git history and immutable release tags rather than being repeated as a second changelog.

## Qualification evidence

The current audited production-source baseline is commit `3539ed2b4b80d216618f0295b9c79f2728745eba`. In Project quality gate run 36222148610, that exact candidate completed the warnings-as-errors C/C++ build and all 44 native/filesystem/GUI/release CTest tests successfully; the independent hosted ASan/UBSan lane also passed. Self-hosted Local Linux / heavy qualification run 36222148336 completed its dependency check, strict build and native/filesystem/GUI tests successfully. Both candidate runs stopped only at the deliberate stale completed-audit control, which this 1.8.0-212 audit advance resolves.

The reviewed identity delta makes first-party filesystem code the authority that unlocks physical mutation. Linux filesystem metadata and Test Media GPT labels remain useful routing candidates, but they do not expose write operations. A physical target stays mutation-disabled until the selected native analyser successfully returns a compatible filesystem identity. Root-only Test Media slots can remain visible as identity-pending candidates so privileged read-only Analyse can prove them; a stale or mismatched slot label cannot enable a writer. Verified identity is retained across rediscovery only when stable filesystem or partition identity still matches, and a conflicting native result fails closed.

The reviewed allocation-map delta strengthens the filesystem-neutral protocol boundary. Native map validation and GTK presentation now require every cell to account exactly for its physical span across free, used, unknown, outside and bad primary states; fragmented and directory overlays may never exceed used allocation. This adds a second independent contract check around the filesystem-specific mappers without changing placement or mutation semantics.

The reviewed documentation delta removes another duplicated release-version authority and aligns repository/source/contributor build examples with the established N-1 CPU policy. The release-governance baseline remains `36be157f932006672f4dfae1c41b83317a914f46`; workflow semantics are unchanged.

The malformed-media matrix, transaction/recovery tests, native integration fixtures, GUI contract tests, release/package tests and architecture ownership checks remain part of the permanent **Project quality gate**. Environment-dependent destructive media evidence is supplementary and is not represented as hosted-CI proof.

## Current safety case

Write-capable engines are admitted only when the parser, placement model, durable recovery contract and independent final verification agree on the same bounded on-disk subset. Unsupported, structurally ambiguous, mounted or identity-mismatched targets fail closed before authoritative writes.

- **FAT12/FAT16/FAT32** — native allocation/catalogue analysis, canonical relocation, exact 10% Growth Defrag reserve and Recover.
- **exFAT** — native catalogue/relayout, exact 10% Growth Defrag reserve and Recover.
- **NTFS** — native fail-closed preflight, bounded relocation, exact Growth Defrag reserve and Recover; persistent journal mechanics are separated from filesystem-specific placement/recovery semantics.
- **EXT2/EXT3/EXT4** — first-party native on-disk superblock/group/bitmap/inode validation, extent and legacy-indirect traversal, allocation mutation, metadata checksum maintenance, staged commit and Recover. Production mutation no longer links libext2fs; e2fsprogs/libext2fs remains test-only independent fixture/oracle evidence.
- **XFS** — native raw userspace catalogue, planning, allocation-metadata reconstruction, verification and Recover for the qualified v5 contract.
- **Btrfs** — exact first-party analysis plus bounded offline Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and Recover for the single-device CRC32C, level-0 mixed-group subset; unsupported profiles, sharing, encoding, snapshots/qgroups and active transaction state fail closed.
- **Amiga OFS/FFS** — native raw catalogue, relocation, verification and Recover for the qualified classic layout; allocation is trusted only with a valid root bitmap-valid word, and DOS\\6/DOS\\7 long-name layouts fail closed.
- **Amiga SFS0/SFS2** — native supported-subset relayout and Recover with format-specific metadata checksums, 107-character namespace validation, SFS2 48-bit file-size encoding and 32-bit extent geometry.
- **Amiga PFS3** — bounded small-disk native allocation/anode analysis, Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and Recover with validated root-extension roving/delete-directory/filename geometry and directory-entry extension bounds.
- **Classic Macintosh HFS** — exact allocation/catalog analysis plus bounded offline Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and Recover for clean volumes whose regular-file fork maps are completely understood.
- **HFS+/HFSX** — native staged transaction and Recover for the qualified clean/journal state.
- **Minix v1/v2/v3** — exact native analysis plus recoverable Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and Recover.
- **APFS** — exact checkpoint/spaceman/catalog analysis plus bounded offline Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and Recover for a **single active two-object checkpoint**, direct-CIB, unencrypted/unsealed, snapshot-free, flat-tree subset; shared/cloned/sparse/unsupported state fails closed.
- **UFS1/UFS2** — exact cylinder-group allocation and inode block-tree fragmentation analysis plus bounded clean, non-journalled, snapshot-free Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and durable Recover.

ZFS/OpenZFS and Linux swap are complete by design as analysis-only. ZFS exactness is bounded to the qualified single-disk topology and rejects unsupported block forms, read-critical MOS features, checksums/compression and active log-space-map state rather than approximating them. Raw ZFS mutation is outside product scope because Defragmenter does not replace the filesystem's CoW/TXG transaction engine or claim an exact persistent post-file reserve that ZFS itself may relocate.

## Safety invariants

The audited writers preserve these release invariants:

1. target identity and physical capacity are captured and revalidated before authoritative publication;
2. mounted or overlapping raw targets are refused;
3. mutation begins only from a fully validated catalogue/plan within the writer's declared subset;
4. recovery material is durably published before source bytes can require recovery;
5. transaction state cannot silently switch target, regress phase or reuse stale identity;
6. Stop is observed only at a valid clean or recoverable boundary;
7. success requires independent reopened verification of payload, metadata and requested layout;
8. unsupported or ambiguous filesystem state does not write;
9. GUI/helper control loss cannot detach an active privileged writer from supervision.

## Dependency baseline

The audited production tree consumes Infiltratr Common 1.19.27 at exact commit `3ef3710df6563df305b6d8e2dc9d1a41c61843ba`. CMake, the local installer, the Git submodule and release regressions assert the same released pin.

Common owns generic checked arithmetic, strict numeric/config parsing, endian access, bounded growth, path/string primitives, exact I/O, generic durable-file operations, design metrics/semantic roles, typography identity and canonical font provenance. Defragmenter retains filesystem geometry and interpretation, target-safety policy, placement, transaction/recovery semantics and allocation-map meaning. This boundary is enforced by architecture tests rather than documentation alone.

## Release controls and decision

The repository uses the `direct-main` development model. The active `protected-main` history contract, exact audited source/governance baselines, immutable release checks and hosted **Project quality gate** collectively guard publication.

Ordinary main commits never publish. An **explicit release decision** is represented by a commit whose subject begins `Release <version>`. The exact head must pass the hosted full-suite and ASan/UBSan lanes; release automation then verifies the version, audit baselines, source/workflow drift and immutable tag identity before creating the GitHub release.

APT refresh remains a direct release-workflow stage, but publication ownership is pull-based: Defragmenter validates and records its immutable released identity without cross-repository dispatch credentials, while Infiltrator-Repository independently discovers the release on its own schedule.
