This document records the current release safety case. Historical audit-development detail remains in Git history and immutable release tags rather than being repeated as a second changelog.

## Qualification evidence

The current audited production-source baseline is commit `07e731c99c53c59d2f12fad779eef166332699a2`. In Project quality gate run 36233678874, that exact candidate completed the warnings-as-errors C/C++ build and all 44 native/filesystem/GUI/release CTest tests successfully; the independent hosted ASan/UBSan lane also passed. Self-hosted Local Linux / heavy qualification run 36233678598 completed its dependency check, strict build and native/filesystem/GUI tests successfully. Both ordinary candidate gates stopped only at the deliberate stale completed-audit control, which this 1.8.0-214 audit advance resolves.

The reviewed scalability delta packs boolean allocation state instead of retaining one byte per allocation unit where only yes/no state is required. HFS, Amiga OFS/FFS/SFS/PFS3 and the remaining PFS3 staging map use the shared bitmap primitive; FAT's four independent map classifications are stored as four bitsets. This reduces memory growth on large media without changing filesystem placement semantics.

The reviewed safety-boundary delta moves destructive Test Media disk identity, whole-disk validation and active-system-use detection to the filesystem-neutral native device layer. The boundary reads sysfs, udev metadata, /proc/self/mountinfo and /proc/swaps directly and fails closed when identity or topology cannot be established; lsblk/findmnt remain convenience/discovery tools rather than destructive authorities.

The reviewed protocol delta makes optional native mapper fields strict when present, replaces Test Media substring extraction with bounded structural JSON scanning and caps captured mapper output at 8 MiB. Malformed fields and runaway child output are now explicit failures rather than default values or unbounded memory growth.

The reviewed transaction/runtime delta standardises remaining checked vector growth and routes writer durability barriers through the shared EINTR-safe sync primitive while retaining filesystem-specific journal schemas, placement rules and recovery state machines.

The reviewed regression delta fixes the Test Media Amiga payload builder to consume the packed AFFS allocation bitmap correctly and activates the forensic scalability/protocol/safety architecture guard that had previously been defined after the test script entry point.

The release-governance baseline remains `36be157f932006672f4dfae1c41b83317a914f46`; workflow semantics are unchanged. The malformed-media matrix, transaction/recovery tests, native integration fixtures, GUI contract tests, release/package tests and architecture ownership checks remain part of the permanent **Project quality gate**. Environment-dependent destructive media evidence is supplementary and is not represented as hosted-CI proof.

## Current safety case

Write-capable engines are admitted only when the parser, placement model, durable recovery contract and independent final verification agree on the same bounded on-disk subset. Unsupported, structurally ambiguous, mounted or identity-mismatched targets fail closed before authoritative writes.

- **FAT12/FAT16/FAT32** — native allocation/catalogue analysis, canonical relocation, exact 10% Growth Defrag reserve and Recover.
- **exFAT** — native catalogue/relayout, exact 10% Growth Defrag reserve and Recover.
- **NTFS** — native fail-closed preflight, bounded relocation, exact Growth Defrag reserve and Recover; persistent journal mechanics are separated from filesystem-specific placement/recovery semantics.
- **EXT2/EXT3/EXT4** — first-party native on-disk superblock/group/bitmap/inode validation, extent and legacy-indirect traversal, allocation mutation, metadata checksum maintenance, staged commit and Recover. Production mutation no longer links libext2fs; e2fsprogs/libext2fs remains test-only independent fixture/oracle evidence.
- **XFS** — native raw userspace catalogue, planning, allocation-metadata reconstruction, verification and Recover for the qualified v5 contract.
- **Btrfs** — exact first-party analysis plus bounded offline Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and Recover for the single-device CRC32C, level-0 mixed-group subset; unsupported profiles, sharing, encoding, snapshots/qgroups and active transaction state fail closed.
- **Amiga OFS/FFS** — native raw catalogue, relocation, verification and Recover for the qualified classic layout; allocation is trusted only with a valid root bitmap-valid word, and DOS\\6/DOS\\7 long-name layouts fail closed.
- **Amiga SFS0/SFS2** — native supported-subset relayout and Recover with format-specific metadata checksums, 107-character namespace validation, SFS2 48-bit file-size encoding and 32-bit extent geometry.
- **Amiga PFS3** — bounded small-disk native allocation/anode analysis, Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and Recover with validated root-extension roving/delete-directory/filename geometry and directory-entry extension bounds.
- **Classic Macintosh HFS** — exact allocation/catalog analysis plus bounded offline Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and Recover for clean volumes whose regular-file fork maps are completely understood.
- **HFS+/HFSX** — native staged transaction and Recover for the qualified clean/journal state.
- **Minix v1/v2/v3** — exact native analysis plus recoverable Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and Recover.
- **APFS** — exact checkpoint/spaceman/catalog analysis plus bounded offline Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and Recover for a **single active two-object checkpoint**, direct-CIB, unencrypted/unsealed, snapshot-free, flat-tree subset; shared/cloned/sparse/unsupported state fails closed.
- **UFS1/UFS2** — exact cylinder-group allocation and inode block-tree fragmentation analysis plus bounded clean, non-journalled, snapshot-free Defragment, exact 10% Growth Defrag and durable Recover.

ZFS/OpenZFS and Linux swap are complete by design as analysis-only. ZFS exactness is bounded to the qualified single-disk topology and rejects unsupported block forms, read-critical MOS features, checksums/compression and active log-space-map state rather than approximating them. Raw ZFS mutation is outside product scope because Defragmenter does not replace the filesystem's CoW/TXG transaction engine or claim an exact persistent post-file reserve that ZFS itself may relocate.

## Safety invariants

The audited writers preserve these release invariants:

1. target identity and physical capacity are captured and revalidated before authoritative publication;
2. mounted or overlapping raw targets are refused;
3. mutation begins only from a fully validated catalogue/plan within the writer's declared subset;
4. recovery material is durably published before source bytes can require recovery;
5. transaction state cannot silently switch target, regress phase or reuse stale identity;
6. Stop is observed only at a valid clean or recoverable boundary;
7. success requires independent reopened verification of payload, metadata and requested layout;
8. unsupported or ambiguous filesystem state does not write;
9. GUI/helper control loss cannot detach an active privileged writer from supervision.

## Dependency baseline

The audited production tree consumes Infiltratr Common 1.19.27 at exact commit `3ef3710df6563df305b6d8e2dc9d1a41c61843ba`. CMake, the local installer, the Git submodule and release regressions assert the same released pin.

Common owns generic checked arithmetic, strict numeric/config parsing, endian access, bounded growth, path/string primitives, exact I/O, generic durable-file operations, design metrics/semantic roles, typography identity and canonical font provenance. Defragmenter retains filesystem geometry and interpretation, target-safety policy, placement, transaction/recovery semantics and allocation-map meaning. This boundary is enforced by architecture tests rather than documentation alone.

## Release controls and decision

The repository uses the `direct-main` development model. The active `protected-main` history contract, exact audited source/governance baselines, immutable release checks and hosted **Project quality gate** collectively guard publication.

Ordinary main commits never publish. An **explicit release decision** is represented by a commit whose subject begins `Release <version>`. The exact head must pass the hosted full-suite and ASan/UBSan lanes; release automation then verifies the version, audit baselines, source/workflow drift and immutable tag identity before creating the GitHub release.

APT refresh remains a direct release-workflow stage, but publication ownership is pull-based: Defragmenter validates and records its immutable released identity without cross-repository dispatch credentials, while Infiltrator-Repository independently discovers the release on its own schedule.
